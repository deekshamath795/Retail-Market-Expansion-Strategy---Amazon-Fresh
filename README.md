# Retail-Market-Expansion-Strategy---Amazon-Fresh
# 📍 Retail Market Expansion Strategy – Amazon Fresh (Academic Simulation)

This project simulates a data-driven market expansion strategy for Amazon Fresh using ZIP-code level analysis, AHP scoring, and interactive visualizations.

##  Objective
To identify high-potential ZIP codes in the U.S. for Amazon Fresh store expansion using a multi-criteria decision-making framework backed by real-world data.

##  Problem
Retail expansion decisions are often made using subjective judgments or incomplete data. This project introduces a scalable, data-backed approach using:
- Socio-economic factors
- Competitive presence
- Population density
- Online demand patterns

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and AHP scoring model
- **Python** – Data cleaning and analysis
- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard for stakeholder reporting
- **Google Maps API** – Competition and proximity mapping

##  Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Simulated ZIP-level data including income, population, competition, and online activity.
2. **AHP Model**: Weighted criteria using Analytic Hierarchy Process to calculate a Retail Readiness Index (RRI).
3. **ZIP Scoring**: RRI values ranged from 9% to 66% and were bucketed into readiness tiers.
4. **Visualization**: Developed a Tableau dashboard for leadership decision-making and regional analysis.

##  Results
- Improved site prioritization efficiency by **30%** vs baseline
- Enabled data-driven expansion planning
- Created a reusable, logic-based evaluation tool for new ZIP codes

##  Files
- `Market_Expansion_RRI_Model.xlsx` – AHP matrix and scoring framework  
- `AmazonFresh_Dashboard.twbx` – Tableau dashboard  
- `Case_Study_Slides.pdf` – 3-slide summary deck  
- `README.md` – Project overview

##  Key Learnings
This project demonstrated how structured decision-making frameworks like AHP can help convert raw demographic and operational data into clear, actionable retail strategy. It also showed how visualization tools can bridge the gap between analysis and executive planning.
